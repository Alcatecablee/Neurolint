## Social Media Posts

### Twitter/X Launch Announcement

**Main Launch Tweet:**
```
NeuroLint is LIVE on Product Hunt!

I built a tool that actually fixes your code — no AI hallucinations, just deterministic AST transformations.

700+ ESLint errors? Fixed in seconds.

Check it out and let me know what you think:

**Thread Version (more engagement):**

🧵 I just launched NeuroLint on Product Hunt. Here's the story:

1/ A few months ago, I was drowning in 700+ ESLint errors, hydration bugs, and missing React keys on my side project.

2/ Out of frustration, I told Cursor to "think outside the box" — and it created something unexpected: a layered fix system that dropped my errors from 600+ to 70.

3/ We kept going. Every new class of bugs got its own intelligent layer. Eventually I had 7 layers working together through an orchestrator.

4/ That accidental chaos became NeuroLint — a rule-based code fixing tool that:

→ Uses AST transformations, not regex hacks
→ Produces deterministic output (no AI randomness)
→ Works on React, Next.js, TypeScript
→ Is completely free (Apache 2.0)

5/ Today it's live on Product Hunt.

Would love your support and honest feedback:

### LinkedIn Launch Post

```
Excited to share that NeuroLint is now live on Product Hunt!

The backstory: I was working on a side project when I got hit with 700+ ESLint errors, hydration bugs, and missing React keys. Instead of fixing them manually, I accidentally built a 7-layer automated fixing system.

That system became NeuroLint — a CLI tool that actually fixes your code:

- Config optimization (tsconfig, next.config.js)
- Pattern fixes (console.log removal, unused imports)
- React best practices (keys, accessibility)
- Hydration guards (SSR safety)
- Next.js directives
- Testing improvements
- Adaptive learning

Unlike AI tools that can hallucinate, NeuroLint uses deterministic AST transformations. Same input = same output. Every time.

It's completely free and open source (Apache 2.0).

Check it out on Product Hunt — I'd love your feedback:

NeuroLint is TRENDING on Product Hunt! 🔥

This started as an accident — frustration + Cursor + 700 errors = a 7-layer fix system.

Now it's helping developers ship cleaner code faster.

What a day! 🙏

NeuroLint finished with [X] upvotes on Product Hunt.

Huge thanks to everyone who:
- Upvoted and commented
- Shared feedback (I'm implementing suggestions already)
- Spread the word

This is just the beginning. Here's what's coming next:
→ [Feature 1]

Hey [Name],

Quick note — I just launched NeuroLint on Product Hunt today!

You might remember me mentioning the CLI tool that automatically fixes React/Next.js code. It started as an accident (debugging 700+ errors) and became a full 7-layer fix system.

Would mean the world if you could:
1. Check out the Product Hunt page: [Link]
2. Leave a comment with your thoughts
3. Share with anyone who might find it useful

No pressure at all — just excited to finally ship this.

Thanks!
[Your name]

P.S. It's completely free and open source. Install with: npm install -g @neurolint/cli
```
