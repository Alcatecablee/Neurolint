NeuroLint is LIVE on Product Hunt!

I built a tool that actually fixes your code — no AI hallucinations, just deterministic AST transformations.

700+ ESLint errors? Fixed in seconds.

Check it out and let me know what you think:

Excited to share that NeuroLint is now live on Product Hunt!

I accidentally built a 7-layer automated fixing system while debugging 700+ ESLint errors. That became NeuroLint — a CLI that actually fixes your React/Next.js code.

Unlike AI tools that hallucinate, it uses deterministic AST transformations. Same input = same output.

Completely free and open source (Apache 2.0).

Would love your feedback: [PRODUCT HUNT LINK]

Just launched NeuroLint on Product Hunt! 🚀

CLI tool that auto-fixes React/Next.js code — ESLint errors, hydration bugs, missing keys.

Rule-based (no AI), 7 fix layers, completely free.

**For comparisons to other tools:**

Good question! The main difference is NeuroLint is deterministic — no AI randomness. Same input always produces the same output. It's rule-based AST transformations, not LLM-generated fixes.
